## Dynamic Changes

This is a simple webapp to demonstrate how to use docker to run your applications.

In order to make changes available in docker we should user volumes.
Volumes are the preferred mechanism for persisting data generated by and used by Docker containers

docker run -v /app/node_modules -v (pwd):/app sakerini/reactapp

## Development Workflow

The most simple development workflow consists of Development, Testing, Production deployment.
In docker there is Dockerfile.dev that can be used for Development build file.
By default **docker build** will look for file named Dockerfile (without .dev) so if we have only
Dockerfile.dev it will result in an error. In order to make Dockerfile.dev work we use **docker build -f Dockerfile.dev .** .

- **npm run start** starts a development server. For development use only.
- **npm run test** Run tests associated with the project
- **npm run build** Builds a production version of the application

## Example -- Dockerfile
```js
# Base image
FROM node:alpine as builder

# WORKING DIRECTORY
WORKDIR '/app' 

#DEPENDENCIES`
COPY package.json .
RUN npm install

#Copy sources
COPY . .

#RUN CMD
RUN npm run build

FROM nginx
COPY --from=builder /app/build /usr/share/nginx/html	
```

## Example -- Dockerfile
```js
# Base image
FROM node:alpine

# WORKING DIRECTORY
WORKDIR '/app'

#DEPENDENCIES
COPY package.json .
RUN npm install

#Copy sources
COPY . .

# Default Cmd
CMD ["npm", "run", "start"]	
```


## Usage
**docker build .**
